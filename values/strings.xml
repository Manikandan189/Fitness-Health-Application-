    <string name="take">How to take:</string>


    <string name="what">Whats is Carbohydrates ?</string>
    <string name="what1">Carbohydrates are organic compounds consisting of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They are classified into simple carbohydrates (sugars) and complex carbohydrates (starches and fiber)</string>
    <string name="does1">Carbohydrates serve as the primary and preferred source of energy for the body. Glucose, the product of carbohydrate breakdown, is essential for fueling cellular processes, especially in the brain and muscles.</string>
    <string name="processed1">During digestion, complex carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars (glucose, fructose, and galactose), which are then absorbed into the bloodstream. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, helps cells take up glucose for energy or storage in the liver and muscles.</string>
    <string name="per1">The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that 45-65% of daily caloric intake should come from carbohydrates. For adults, the recommended daily intake is around 130 grams, but individual needs vary based on factors such as age, gender, activity level, and overall health.</string>
    <string name="take1"> Prioritize whole, unprocessed carbohydrates from sources like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. Limit the intake of added sugars from processed foods and beverages\n\n\n\n</string>


    <string name="what2">What is Protein?</string>
    <string name="what3">Proteins are complex macromolecules composed of amino acids, which are crucial for building and repairing tissues in the body.</string>
    <string name="does2">Proteins play essential roles in immune function, enzyme production, and the structure of muscles, organs, and skin. They also serve as a source of energy when needed.</string>
    <string name="processed2">During digestion, proteins are broken down into individual amino acids, which are then absorbed into the bloodstream and used for various physiological functions, including the synthesis of new proteins.</string>
    <string name="per2">The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is approximately 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight for adults. However, individual protein needs can vary based on factors such as age, activity level, and health status.</string>
    <string name="take2">Include a variety of protein sources in your diet, such as lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, legumes, and plant-based options like tofu and tempeh\n\n\n\n.</string>


    <string name="what4">What is Fat?</string>
    <string name="what5">Fats are organic molecules that are a concentrated source of energy, consisting of fatty acids and glycerol.</string>
    <string name="does3">Fats are essential for energy storage, hormone production, cell structure, and the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). They also provide insulation and protection for organs.</string>
    <string name="processed3">Dietary fats are broken down into fatty acids and glycerol during digestion. These components are then absorbed into the bloodstream and used for energy or stored in adipose tissue.</string>
    <string name="per3">The Dietary Guidelines recommend that 20-35% of daily caloric intake should come from fats. Its important to limit saturated and trans fats while prioritizing sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.</string>
    <string name="take3">Choose healthy fat sources, including avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish. Limit the consumption of processed and fried foods high in unhealthy fats.\n\n\n\n</string>

    <string name="water_perday">Adequate daily intake varies, influenced by factors such as climate, physical activity, and individual health. A general guideline is to drink about 8 cups (64 ounces) or more per day.</string>
    <string name="water_take">Consume water from various sources, including beverages and water-rich foods. Thirst is a natural indicator of hydration needs. Individual requirements may vary, so adjust intake based on factors like climate and activity level.\n\n\n\n</string>


    <string name="fiber_what">What is Dietary Fiber?</string>
    <string name="fiber_whatInfo">Dietary fiber consists of non-digestible carbohydrates found in plant foods.</string>
    <string name="fiber_does">Fiber promotes digestive health, helps prevent constipation, and may contribute to weight management by promoting a feeling of fullness.</string>
    <string name="fiber_process">Fiber remains largely intact during digestion, adding bulk to the stool and promoting regular bowel movements. Some types of fiber can also be fermented by gut bacteria.</string>
    <string name="fiber_perday">Recommended daily intake varies, but a general guideline is around 25 grams for adult women and 38 grams for adult men.</string>
    <string name="fiber_take">Include a variety of fiber-rich foods in your diet, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts. Gradually increase fiber intake to avoid digestive discomfort.\n\n\n\n</string>


    <string name="antioxidants_what">What are Antioxidants?</string>

    <string name="antioxidants_process">Antioxidants are obtained from various foods and supplements. They work by donating electrons to stabilize free radicals, thereby reducing cellular damage.</string>
    <string name="antioxidants_perday">There is no specific daily recommendation for antioxidants, but a varied and colorful diet rich in fruits and vegetables provides a broad spectrum of these compounds.</string>
    <string name="antioxidants_take">Consume a diverse array of colorful fruits and vegetables, as well as nuts, seeds, and whole grains. Supplements may be considered in certain cases, but a balanced diet is generally the preferred source.\n\n\n\n</string>


    <string name="probiotics_what">What are Probiotics?</string>
    <string name="probiotics_whatInfo">Probiotics are live microorganisms that confer health benefits, particularly to the digestive system.</string>
    <string name="probiotics_does">Probiotics help maintain a healthy balance of gut bacteria, supporting digestion and overall gut health. They may also have immune-modulating effects.</string>
    <string name="probiotics_process">Probiotics, when consumed, reach the gut and interact with the existing microbial community, influencing the balance of beneficial bacteria.</string>
    <string name="probiotics_perday">There is no specific daily requirement for probiotics, but regular consumption of probiotic-rich foods can contribute to gut health.</string>
    <string name="probiotics_take">Include fermented foods such as yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi in your diet. Probiotic supplements may be considered, especially after antibiotic use or for individuals with specific digestive issues.\n\n\n\n</string>


    <string name="prebiotics_what">What are Prebiotics?</string>
    <string name="prebiotics_whatInfo">Prebiotics are non-digestible fibers that promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.</string>
